# Request for collaboration.

I don't have time to manage update to `Rpi-Monitor`. 

The project looks to be used be many people. Some PR need to be reviewed and merged and next version is requiring tests.

If one of you would like to help to manage the project, I'll be happy to grant her/him the right on `Rpi-Monitor` repository.

I let you contact me if you are interrested.

Thanks,
